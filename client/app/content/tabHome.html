    <p>I hope you all will enjoy this ad-free stream as I continue to develop it.  :)</p>

    <p>Please consider donating--any sum will do.  Maintaining this stream alone is surprisingly costly in terms of time and resources, and as some of you can tell, my webhost and domain name have expired as well.</p>

    <p>However, I would like to stress that these are <strong>donations</strong>.  You have absolutely zero obligation to donate, and furthermore, not doing so will have no effect on the stream.</p>

    <p>Much, much, much more to come in the next month or two...</p>

    <p>Cheers!  :)</p>
